Clks have been implicated to play a role in the regulation of alternative splicing [1]; while Dyrks, in particular over expression of Dyrk1A, has been linked to diseases as Down syndrome (DS; OMIM 190685) [2] and Alzheimer disease (AD; OMIM 104300) [3].  Among the members of the CMGC group, the Clks and the Dyrks are very closely related [4] therefore to determine validity and selectivity of an active compound observed in the CLK4 qHTS screen (AID:1770), a bioluminescent counter-screen against Dyrk1A was developed. In addition, potent and selective compounds against Dyrk1A were identified to further assess the role of this enzyme in DS and AD.  Dyrk1A (Invitrogen, cat # PV3785) was assayed using ATP and DYRKtide (AnaSpec, cat# 62698) as substrates. Promega Kinase-Glo  (cat# V6712) technology was used to detect the residual ATP following kinetic reaction. The Kinase-Glo Plus contains Ultra-Glo [5] luciferase and D-luciferin which generates a bioluminescence signal from the remaining ATP. No enzyme and harmine (Sigma, cat # 286044-1G), a compound shown to inhibit Dyrks [6] were used as a positive control; while DMSO treatment was used as a negative control. ",
